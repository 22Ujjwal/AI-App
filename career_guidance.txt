Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to improve my career based on the resume I have. Let me start by going through each section of my resume and see what stands out.

First, my education is from Dallas College as a sophomore, majoring in Computer Science at Texas A&M University. That's pretty solid. My professional experience includes Snap Inc., where I worked on augmented reality development for two months. That sounds interesting but maybe a bit technical. Then HP Tech Ventures, where I was a Business Analyst for four months. That position probably involved more business acumen and analytical skills.

Looking at my tools and techniques, I'm proficient in Python, C++, Java, SQL, and other languages. I also use tools like Power BI, Tableau, Jira, and MS DevOps. My academic projects include a NLP chatbot for car services, which is pretty impressive. Plus, I've been involved with several blockchain-related projects and leadership roles at TAMU.

Now, I want to think about how to improve my career. Maybe I should focus on gaining more experience in a specific area where I'm interested. Since I have some experience in augmented reality and business analytics, maybe I can expand into other areas like AI or machine learning since those are hot topics right now.

I also notice that I have leadership roles at Texas A&M, which is great for developing management skills. Maybe I should focus on gaining more hands-on experience in leadership to build my confidence in handling professional situations.

I wonder if I should consider further education beyond my current degree. Maybe a master's or PhD in Computer Science could open up more opportunities in research or specialized fields. Alternatively, getting certifications in specific areas like AWS or Google Cloud might also be beneficial.

Another thought is about networking and building connections within the tech industry. I can look into attending conferences, joining professional groups, and maybe even starting my own LinkedIn profile to share relevant projects and insights.

I should also think about how to stay updated on industry trends. Maybe subscribing to newsletters or following experts on social media could help me learn more about what's happening in the field.

Perhaps I can take some online courses that align with my interests, like advanced AI courses or machine learning workshops. This might help me grow both professionally and personally.

I also need to assess where I stand academically. While my GPA is good, maybe I should aim for a higher score if possible. Additionally, getting involved in research projects could provide valuable experience beyond just academic work.

In terms of career advice, I think it's important to consider the long-term goals and what industries I'm interested in joining. Maybe starting with a project or two that aligns with my interests before seeking a full-time position would be better than jumping into a job right away.

I should also reflect on my strengths and weaknesses. While I have strong technical skills, maybe there's an area where I can improve more. For example, while I'm good at Python, perhaps getting some experience in machine learning could help me develop those skills further.

Overall, it seems like I have a solid foundation with experience in augmented reality and business analytics, which are valuable. By focusing on gaining more hands-on experience in specific areas of interest, building leadership skills, and staying updated on industry trends, I can improve my career prospects.
